Me
I am a product owner in a very technical field with a degree in materials engineering. After several years in academics and science, I started as a software developer, architect, consultant and project manager. Finally I settled as a product owner and think that&rsquo;s my best decision ever.
I am no English native speaker! Please excuse if texts are not perfect. I double check them with a LLM but for a first time publication I dare to use the raw version.">
