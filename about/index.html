<p>I am no English native speaker! Please excuse if texts are not perfect. I double check them with a LLM but for a first time publication I dare to use the raw version.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-blog">Why this blog?</h2>
<p>First, for myself as personal notebook of my thoughts about different topics.
Second, maybe to be helpful for other people or at least interesting.
Third, to get feedback, ideas and inspiration from others. As a social species we are much more creative and productive as a horde. :)</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<li>Be kind</li>
<li>Be respectful</li>
